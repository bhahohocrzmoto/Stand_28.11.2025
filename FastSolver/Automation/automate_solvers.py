"""Batch runner for FastHenry and FasterCap.

This script reads a list of geometry folders from an Address.txt file and
runs the existing ``run_fasthenry.py`` and ``run_fastercap.py`` utilities
for each entry. It expects each listed folder to contain a ``FastSolver``
subdirectory with the two generated solver inputs:

* ``Wire_Sections.inp`` (for FastHenry)
* ``Wire_Sections_FastCap.txt`` (for FasterCap)

The outputs ``Zc.mat`` and ``CapacitanceMatrix.txt`` are checked after each
run and warnings are printed if anything is missing.
